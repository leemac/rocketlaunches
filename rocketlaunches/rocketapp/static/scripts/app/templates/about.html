			<h3>About</h3>

		<p><a href="http://RocketLaunches.net">RocketLaunches.net</a> aims to provide visitors with information regarding Rocket Launches around the world. The end goal is to provide interesting information about launches, manufacturers and the rockets themselves.</p>

		<p>This site was created by <a href="http://leemckinnon.com">Lee McKinnon</a> (that's me). I created this site after many years of being fascinated by space travel and the technology behind it. I wanted to start this project as I saw an opportunity to create a one-stop-shop for all things rockets, the launches and the industry as a whole.</p>

		<p>The initial version (1.0) was developed entirely during Christmas week of 2014 and it went public in January 2015. It is currently pretty basic, but I hope to add more functionality very soon.</p>

		<p>I will carefully update the data over time and will add features as requested. The source of the data varies from all over the web.</p>
